        The machines in this repo are still on kernel < 4.15 so let's not use
        wireless-regdb-static just yet. When they will use a kernel >= 4.15
        let's switch then from crda to wireless-regdb-static.

                Lets pass it here to keep it correct.


                Should not have any actual affect. NM plugin was built with
                reference

                to the 2.4.7 headers. Just the directoy path would say 2.4.5
                misleading

                We also delete the patch that switched the 12d1:1f01 modems to
                NCM mode with that specific MessageContent because that made
                other Huawei modems that used the same vid:pid combination
                unusable in that mode. So now these modems will work in the old
                Hilink mode using cdc_ether instead.

                Some devices have special tools in the initramfs that bloat it.

                e.g. Jetson family have tegra-firmware-xusb etc.


                IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE triggers an error if the rootfs goes beyond
                this

                limit. This does not force the rootfs to an empty fixed size.


                We can comfortably increase the max size to 32MB to reduce
                unnecessary

                patches in the device integration layers.


                We'll still be covered by the full resin-rootA size limit.

              hash: b4122eeea971dfc9325885cc7c896c733cf60920
              body: >
                The DNS clients (applications) resolver libraries use the
                timeout value in

                /etc/resolv.conf to set the time between DNS attempts. The
                default is 5

                secs which for slow networks like cellular mean lots of DNS
                requests on

                a bandwidth sensitive channel.


                This change modifies the default to 15 secs. This timeout only
                applies

                when DNS servers are unresponsive so it will not affect the
                normal

                functionality.

                This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5
                hours.


                BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to
                specify

                a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two
                number of

                seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.


                With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s
                (4.55h) for

                all servers.


                An architectural decision has been made not to make this
                configurable.


                Fixes #1780.

                Removed the two patches we included in favor of corresponding
                configure arguments since they had to be updated anyway.

                It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
                is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
                internal block testing feature. This is because there is
                at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
                as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
                written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

                We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME

                which includes DATETIME


                DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a
                state

                where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.


                But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs,
                the

                DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have
                to

                run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up
                directories.


                Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make
                it

                run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with
                the

                most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

                Need to make the script go in the background in ExecStartPost=.

                Otherwise, the service status never gets to active/running
                resulting

                it in remaining stuck in an endless loop.


                If the health-check load fails for whatever reason, the
                subsequent

                engine healthcheck will fail retriggering the healthcheck load.

                We added META_BALENA_VERSION in os-release from v2.38.0 via

                Building it as module ensures that dummy

        Netflix has identified several TCP networking vulnerabilities

        in FreeBSD and Linux kernels. The vulnerabilities specifically

        relate to the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) and TCP

        Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) capabilities.

        The most serious, dubbed SACK Panic, allows a

        remotely-triggered kernel panic on recent Linux kernels.


        These patches address most of these vulnerabilities.
